<h3>What do you do for life ahoora?</h3>
Honestly I work on little projects and do nothing for my life yet! :D <br>
what do you expect from a 19 yo guy whose lives in somewhere without even a programming company?<br>So I used my time to learn more about programming, frameworks and libraries because I'm interested in those kinds of stuff.
